package sorting

// InsertionSort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparisons.
// It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
// However, insertion sort provides several advantages:
//
//   - Simple implementation
//   - Efficient for (quite) small data sets. Although the time complexity is O(nÂ²), it is more efficient in practice
//     than most other simple quadratic algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort.
//   - Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(kn)
//     when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position.
//   - Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
//   - In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
//   - Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it
//
